The weights are found elsewhere!
Reponse from the author:

You can find the PathoSAM pretraned weights at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam/blob/master/micro_sam/util.py#L150-L152, and the additional instance segmentation decoder weights at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam/blob/master/micro_sam/util.py#L163-L165 (see more info in our publication about the additional decoder: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00408).
Normalisation: SA-1B statistics, i.e. the SAM-style one!
